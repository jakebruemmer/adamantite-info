<h1>Adamantite</h1>

A local password manager written in Ruby. Passwords are encrypted and stored on your own
computer without ever sharing your master password or stored information over the internet.

Requires a valid license key to run. You can get one by [PayPal'ing me](https://paypal.me/jakebruemmer?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US)
$5 and then I will send you a license key. 

This is currently a 1 time fee - i.e., a perpetual license, as I get this project more off the ground.
