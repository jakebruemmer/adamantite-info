<h1>Adamantite</h1>
<p>
  A local password manager written in Ruby. Passwords are encrypted and stored on your own
  computer without ever sharing your master password or stored information over the internet.
  
  Requires a valid license key to run. You can get one by [visting this Stripe checkout page](https://buy.stripe.com/dR6g1e6wo8Z46acaEF). Once you complete the checkout, a license key will be emailed to the email address that you provide.
  
  This is currently a 1 time fee - i.e., a perpetual license, as I get this project more off the ground.
